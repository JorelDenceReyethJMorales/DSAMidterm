# React JS
React is a JavaScript **library**, not a **framework**, that helps you build and organize user interfaces for web applications. It works by using **components**, which are self-contained pieces of code that combine reusable JavaScript and HTML. React also uses **JSX (JavaScript XML)**, a syntax that allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside your JavaScript files, making it easier to create and manage web pages.

## Requirements

You will need to know:

- **JavaScript**: Everything up to arrays, classes, objects, and ES6 features such as arrow functions will be necessary.
- **HTML**: React components involve rendering HTML elements and applying CSS.

## Installation

1. You will need a text editor, and I recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. You will also need to download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

**Node.js** is a backend JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

## ReactJS Setup

### Step 1: Create a Project Folder

In VS Code, create a project folder.

### Step 2: Open the Terminal

1. Go to the hamburger menu at the top of VS Code.
2. Click on **Terminal**.
3. Click **New Terminal**.
4. Change it to **Command Prompt**.

### Step 3: Create the Project

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create vite@latest  
```
You can change the project name to my-react-app or choose a name of your choice.

- Select **React** for the framework.
- Select **JavaScript** for the variant.

### Step 4: Install Dependencies and Run the Server
After creating the project, you need to install dependencies and start the development server. Follow these steps:
1. Change the directory to your newly created project:
```bash
cd my-react-app  # Change the directory to where your project is located    
```
2. Install all required dependencies:
```bash
npm install  # Install necessary dependencies
```
3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev  # Start the development server
```
### Step 5: Open the Web Application
Once the development server is running, the web server address will be displayed in the terminal. You can:

- Copy the URL and paste it into your browser, or
- Press h and Enter then Press o and Enter to automatically open it in your browser.


**That's it! You've successfully set up ReactJS and started your development server. Now you're ready to begin building your web application!**
