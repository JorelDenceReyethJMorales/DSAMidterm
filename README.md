# React JS

React is a JavaScript **library**, not a **framework**, that is used to easily build and arrange user interfaces for web applications.

React focuses on building a web application using these things called **components**. A component is a self-contained section of code that functions as reusable building blocks (it has sections of reusable JavaScript and HTML code).

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript known as **JSX (JavaScript XML)**. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files.

React also utilizes a **Virtual DOM**. The Virtual DOM is a lightweight version of the real DOM of a web page, which can track any changes made to the Virtual DOM and only apply those specific changes to the real DOM without needing to refresh the entire web page.

## Requirements

You will need to know:

- **JavaScript**: Everything up to arrays, classes, objects, and ES6 features such as arrow functions will be necessary.
- **HTML**: React components involve rendering HTML elements and applying CSS.

## Installation

1. You will need a text editor, and I recommend **VS Code**. You can get it from [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. You will also need to download **Node.js** from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

**Node.js** is a backend JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

## ReactJS Setup

### Step 1: Create a Project Folder

In VS Code, create a project folder.

### Step 2: Open the Terminal

1. Go to the hamburger menu at the top of VS Code.
2. Click on **Terminal**.
3. Click **New Terminal**.
4. Change it to **Command Prompt**.

### Step 3: Create the Project

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create vite@latest

You can change the project name to my-react-app or choose a name of your choice.

- Select **React** for the framework.
- Select **JavaScript** for the variant.
```
